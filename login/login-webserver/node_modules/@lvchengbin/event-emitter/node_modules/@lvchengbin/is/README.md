# Is

A JavaScript library for checking the type of a value for browsers.

## Installing

```javascript
    npm i @lvchengbin/is --save
```

## Usage

Generally, when we are using some toolkit such as rollup, we don't want to compile a huge library into our project, therefore, to import the files you really need.

```javascript
    import isFunction from '@lvchengbin/is/src/function';
    import array from '@lvchengbin/is/src/array';

    isFunction( async () => {} );
    isArray( [] );
```

If you want to invoke the whole package:

```javascript
    import is from '@lvchengbin/is';

    is.function( () => {} );
    is.array( [] );
```
